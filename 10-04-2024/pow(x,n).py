'''Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 
Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.'''

def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        return int(x**0.5)

x = 4
print(mySqrt(x))
