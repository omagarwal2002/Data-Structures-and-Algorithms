'''Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].'''

def twoSum(numbers, target):
    l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
    while l < r:
        curr_sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
        if curr_sum > target:
                r -= 1
        elif curr_sum < target:
            l += 1
        else:
            return [l + 1, r + 1]
        
print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))
